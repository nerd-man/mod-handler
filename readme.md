# Mod manager

To use this tool, you can place all your mods and mod folders in this directory

It can be structured like follows

Mods (root) <br>
|<br>
|_Foo (Folder)<br>
||<br>
|   |_Bar.jar (Mod)<br>
|   |_Biz.jar (Mod)<br>
|<br>
|_Baz.jar (Mod)<br>

when you run the program, you will get prompted for the location of your MINECRAFT Mod folder (not the one here)

(This will only show up the first time)
